    question: "How much can I make?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We have some experts that sell out within a few minutes and some that
        get a few bookings each month. Based on our math, we believe that
        experts will have the opportunity to generate $500k+ in additional
        yearly revenue.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a minimum time commitment?",
    answer: (
      <>
        You can add as many sessions as you'd like. There are no minimums or
        maximums. We have some experts that offer one hour per month and others
        that offer 50+ hours per month. To make things even easier, Intro will
        integrate with your primary calendar to avoid scheduling conflicts.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How long are the sessions?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Experts can choose to offer sessions ranging from 15 minutes to 3 hours.
        Most experts choose to offer between 15-60 minutes. All video sessions
        have a timer feature preventing your calls from going over the booked
        duration.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How much should I charge?",
    answer: (
      <>
        We recommend taking your hourly rate and adding a 20% premium to it. We
        have experts that charge anywhere from $100 to $2000 per hour ($35 to
        $500 per 15 minute session).
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to prepare for these sessions?",
    answer: (
      <>
        No. Just join the video call, listen to the caller's questions, and help
        them out. It's free form and does not require any work before or after
        the session. Experts can always choose to ask the caller pre-session
        questions to better prepare for the consultation.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to pay a subscription fee to join Preppeer?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Prepeer is free to join. We only make money when our experts do and also
        believe in a fair pricing model. For bookings through our marketplace,
        we ask for a 30% commission. For bookings that our experts produce, we
        ask for a 10% commission.
